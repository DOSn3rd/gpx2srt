# gpx2srt
Small Python script to convert GPX tracks to subtitle files for use as "video overlays"

### Dependencies
haversine =< 0.4.5  
gpxpy =< 1.1.2  

Both sould be avalible from pip

-------

This is more of a proof of concept than a full blown program, but I found it kinda useful so why not.
gpx2srt.py has been tested with GPX files from a Garmin GPSMAP 62s but should work just fine as long as gpxpy supports the file you have.

So far I have only run the script with Python 3.5 and Python 2.7.5 but both seem to work just fine so any 2.X or 3.X version **should** work.
