# gpx2srt
Small Python script to convert GPX tracks to subtitle files for use as "video overlays"

This is more of a proof of concept than a full blown program, but I found it kinda useful so why not.
gpx2srt.py has been tested with GPX files from a Garmin GPSMAP 62s but should work just fine as long as gpxpy supports the file you have.
